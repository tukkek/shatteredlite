Are you tired of going through Act 1 every single time you begin a new playthrough of [Grim Dawn](https://www.grimdawn.com)? **Shatteredlite** is a mod for Grim Dawn's [Shattered Realm](https://grimdawn.fandom.com/wiki/The_Shattered_Realm), allowing you to enjoy more immediate content variety and to **play the game as a roguelite**.

Features:

* Access to the Shattered Realm in as little as a minute after starting a new playthrough!
* A few dozen free tonics and elixirs to help a low-level character tackle the dangers within early-on.
* Only 2 levels per shard instead of the 3 in vanilla.

## How to install

1. [Download the latest release of Shatteredlite](https://github.com/tukkek/shatteredlite/releases/latest/).
2. Extract the ZIP file inside Grim Dawn's `mods` folder.

If you are using [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com), to find the game's installation you can right-click on *Grim Dawn* in your games list and select *Manage â†’ Browse local files*. It should look something like this:

    .../steamapps/common/Grim Dawn/

Your operating system should come with a default archive tool but [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) is a free option in case you need it.

## How to play

1. Create a new character, making sure you select the custom game *Shatteredlite*.
2. Talk to Bourbon and use the new dialog option to refuse to help Devil's Crossing.
3. Optional: play normally until the Burial Cave and clear it to obtain a decent set of starting items and enough experience to reach level 5.
4. Quit to the main menu and enter Shatteredlite again (this is necessary to spawn the Emissary at Devil's Crossing).
5. Talk to the Emissary to gain passage and go to the Conclave of the Three.
6. Talk directly to Mazaan who will now open the Shattered Realm without need for any further tasks.

## Rationale

With DLC, Grim Dawn offers multiple paths to take after finishing the first part of the story but Act 1 is always the same and eventually gets stale, even with the many differences between each palythrough. It's also long, [taking the best players in the community one or two hours to beat](https://youtu.be/Uir5qz5UB0I). That is quite long for a mandatory tutorial of sorts, especially for those players looking for a more [roguelite](https://youtu.be/-cu5RkWoW2M) experience.

After all, why shouldn't Grim Dawn be a roguelite? It has unlimited possibilites for character builds and theorycrafting, a hardcore mode, loot and even a lot of procedural generation - even if maps are static (a shortcoming that the Shattered Realm also mitigates with its many random levels).

Unlocking the Shattered Realm early provides access to over 70 different maps and deeper gameplay compared to early open-world leveling. It's the closest experience to a true roguelite you can get in Grim Dawn, while leveraging the official content already in the game for the most balance and polish.

While there are alternatives to accessing more content early on, they are all clunky, meta-gamey and often hurting early-game balance and progression. The players who are even aware they exist use those because it's the lesser of two evils, not necessarily because they're enjoyable or the best approach to increasing early replay-value.

## Balance

Shatteredlite has been tested under a variety of masteries and character builds for Normal difficulty, [solo-self-found](https://pathofexile.fandom.com/wiki/Solo_Self-Found), hardcore-mode-friendly balance. It is not necessarily easy or fast at first but very doable and overall much faster to level in, compared to completing all the main quests in Act 1.

Players who find this mod too hard even after following the guidelines here are encouraged to clear a little more of Act 1 for extra experience, gear, consumbales and bits to shop with before entering the Shattered Realm proper. Following a [build guide](https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/build-compendium-x-forgotten-gods/49673) might help as well for those struggling to survive in early-level SR.

Upon reaching level 15, vanilla balance can be assumed as this is the minimum level a player is expected to start playing Act 7 after finishing the main quests in Act 1.

### Clearing the burial cave

This suggested optional step before delving into the Shattered Realm proper boils down to a single major concern: having enough area-of-effect damage to tackle the increased enemy density inside the SR shards.

Making a bee-line to the burial cave while killing monsters and looting chests along the way is more than likely to grant you enough experience for level 5, which then unlocks a number of options in [components](https://grimdawn.fandom.com/wiki/Components) - most of which designed specifically to grant the player an area-of-effect skill.

Doing this very-early route will also grant the player enough items to gear up to tackle their first shard; probably one or more of the needed area-of-effect components and hopefully enough [iron bits](https://grimdawn.fandom.com/wiki/Components) to purchase any shortcoming off of the shops in Devil's Crossing or at the Conclave.

### Free consumables

Upon speaking to the Emissary, players are now given a number of tonics and elixirs, much needed to tackle their first shard. For purists, the amount given here may seem excessive so let's examine the reasoning involved.

Upon finishing your first shard in Shatterfield, players are rewarded with a number of chests and a Devotion Shrine. The most purchasing power here comes from the iron bits dropped from the chests: around $10,000. Split roughly evenly between tonics and elixirs, you get those added Emissary freebies.

In other words: the amount given is roughly equivalent to getting one shard-worth of iton bits "in advance" (scaled to an extremely low level too). This seems to be very minimal impact to balance, especially when consumables become practically free early in the game with players being expected to have access to an unlimited stock of them.

Players who disagree with this assessment can discard the freebies received and acquire their own at the Lower Crossing and beyond (or alter the mod to their taste).

Testing a variety of builds has shown the freebies to be necessary - being barely enough to complete the first shard when using consumables liberally and somewhat less so when being more frugal and mindful during gameplay.

Attempting a first shard without any extra consumables is doable but requires a lot of kiting, active management of constitution and food rations or vital essences drops. Some character builds will also struggle more than others (for example, those depending on close-range weapon attacks). This is doable but more like a "nightmare mode" that wouldn't be welcoming to most players (and very different from the balance found otherwise in the vanilla early game).

### Less levels per shard

As a matter of personal preference, I found playing with two shards only to be closer to the balance of exploration and downtime found when playing the acts in Grim Dawn. There is a better dynamic when it comes to the variery of exploration and boss fights and later, inventory management and theorycrafting.

Less levels also allow players to build their starting characters more progressively, gaining less experience and level-ups in a row per shard. Grim Dawn theory-crafting works better by identifying weaknesses and strengths and building accordingly a few steps at a time, rather than having to level up all the way to level 15 in two shards (or at least when you're theorycrafting on-the-go and not relying on a build guide).

Another way having 3 shards in a row is different than the early game is that you are not freely able go back to town and stock up on consumables - this is more of an issue very early on, as it's the only point in the game when players don't have access to a practically-unlimited amount of consumables. In comparison, you can go back to town and spend any iron bits you found on tonics and elixirs at literally any time you're not in active combat during the main quests in Act 1.
